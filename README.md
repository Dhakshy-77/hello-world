First Repository
Hi,
 Welcome to GitHub. This is my first Github try. 
 I have learned that Github is a Distributed version control system. 
 Resporitory is the place where we can have all codes saved.
 In ditributed version control system we have local and remote repository where we can store local and remote code.
 Also I have learned about trunk based developement . It has master branch and new branch. we can use few commands on the branch like push ,pull,commit
 There are also others like gitlab ,bit bucket.
